This has several advantages:\n\nYou don't have to read your data into local memory. One question I get a lot is \"how can I train my ML model if my dataset is just too big to fit on my computer?\". You can subsample your dataset, of course, but you can also use tools like BQML that train your model directly in your database.\n\nYou don't have to use multiple languages. Particularly if you're working in a team where most of your teammates don't know Python or R or your preferred language for modelling, working in SQL can make it easier for you to collaborate.\n\nYou can serve your model immediately after it's trained. Because your model is already in the same place as your data, you can make predictions directly from your database. This lets you get around the hassle of cleaning up your code and either putting it intro production or passing it off to your engineering colleagues.\n\nBQML probably won't replace all your modelling tools, but it's a nice quick way to train and serve a model without spending a lot of time moving code or data around."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Objectives\nIn this tutorial, you will use:\n\nBQML to create a binary logistic regression model using the CREATE MODEL statement\nThe ML.EVALUATE function to evaluate the ML model\nThe ML.PREDICT function to make predictions using the ML model[](http://)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step one: Setup and create your dataset\nFirst, you'll need to create a BigQuery dataset to store your ML model.
