(CNN)The amount of time young children in the United States 
spend with mobile screens might raise some eyebrows, as a new
 report found it has tripled in just four years.

Children 8 and younger spent about 15 minutes a day staring at
a mobile screen in 2013 and now they spend 48 minutes a day, 
according to the report by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit 
organization focused on helping children, parents, and educators
navigate the world of media and technology.

The report, released Thursday, also found that 42% of children 8
and younger now have their own tablet devices, a steep increase
from 7% four years ago and less than 1% in 2011.
